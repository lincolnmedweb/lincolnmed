              <p>
                How do you access the personal information held by this office?
                <br />
                <br />
                You have the right to access your record in a timely manner. If
                you request a copy of your record, one will be provided to you
                at a reasonable cost. If you wish to view the original record,
                one of our staff must be present to maintain the integrity of
                the record, and a reasonable fee may be charged for this access.
                Patient requests for access to the medical record can be made
                verbally or in writing to myself or my staff (see office address
                at top of Policy).

                In extremely limited circumstances you may be denied access to

                significant risk to you or another person.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>What if you feel your record is not accurate?</strong>

                technological and administrative security measures that are
                appropriate to the sensitivity of the information. These
                safeguards are aimed at protecting personal information against
                loss or theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure,
